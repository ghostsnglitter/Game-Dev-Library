# How Can I Contribute?

1. Post issues for errors: Post issues on GitHub using the label `error` to bring spelling or other errors to attention.
2. Post issues for challenges the guide needs to address: Under 1.1 [Purpose](https://github.com/ghostsnglitter/Complete-Guide-For-Solo-Game-Development/blob/main/README.md/#purpose), you can find the different `Objectives` of the development process described in the guide. Each of these objectives has a label that can be used when posting an issue on GitHub. Make sure the title of the issue describes a challenge/obstacle to the chosen objective. If you have ideas for addressing this challenge, add a "possible solution" to the description of the issue.
3. Post ideas: General ideas can be posted in the "Discussions" section on GitHub.
