## 1. Introduction

This guide aims to be a flexible tool to get you started on game development. It will clarify in detail what is necessary to produce a game from start to finish and distribute it, help you create your own workflow and provide unique and unconventional resources for improving your creative process.

Specifically, this guide will cover the different areas of responsibility that you'll be covering as a solo developer, as well as the individual phases of game development, with specific information on the various goals, tools used, strategies for organization, and learning material - always with a focus on *solo* development.

<a name="purpose"></a>
### 1.1 Purpose

If you are an aspiring indie game developer of any skill level, this can serve as a blueprint or valuable reference. If you are a seasoned veteran, this may serve as little more than an interesting glimpse into my process for [`GHOSTS & GLITTER`](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostsnglitter) - although any input from experts is welcome!

Because this process is still WIP, I'm constantly trying to develop it further, always with these principles in mind:

```
Maximize
- Flow
- Experimentation
- Quality of final result
```

```
Minimize
- Cost (time, money, effort)
- Boring work with boring decisions
```

### 1.2 Important Notes

Before we go any further, a few important notes up front:
- This guide covers game development in *Unity* (although this only really becomes important during production).
- I am writing this guide alongside the development of my first game, `SLINGSHOT`, which I will be using as an example throughout.

## 4. Phases of Game Development

This is the main part of the guide. What follows are short descriptions of the different phases of game development, with the titles linking to the detailed articles.

<a name="concept-phase"></a>
### 4.1 [Concept Phase](1_ConceptPhase.md/#concept-phase)

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many ideas into a single, clearly defined Game Concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

<a name="pre-production"></a>
### 4.2 [Pre-Production](2_PreProduction.md/#pre-production)

During Pre-Production, you are going to hash out the most important design decisions. This is done through an iterative process of design and prototyping. You will also consider the resources that will be needed and draw up a plan for the realisation of your game - including an initial timeline - so that you can move on to Production.

<a name="production"></a>
### 4.3 [Production](3_Production.md/#production)

In Production, you will implement the specified design. This too is an interative process consisting of different stages, during which the design may need to be updated. The implementation is accompanied by consistent content preparation for public presentation of the game - with an increased commitment towards the release, which will mark the end of this phase.

<a name="post-release"></a>
### 4.4 [Post-Release](4_PostRelease.md/#post-release)

The Post-Release period is about updating and improving the game, engaging with the community, as well as potentially developing additional content.
